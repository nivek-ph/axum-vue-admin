# axum-admin

Rust + React admin system. The backend exposes REST APIs with Axum, and the
default Admin Console is a React + Vite single-page application.

[Deploy existing projects with Vercel](https://github.com/nivek-ph/axum-admin/actions/workflows/vercel.yml)

## Online Demo

- URL: [https://axum-admin-web.vercel.app](https://axum-admin-web.vercel.app)
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `123456`

The previous Vue 3 + Tauri implementation is available in the
`[v1.1.0](../../tree/v1.1.0)` tag.

## Acknowledgements

Product layout and navigation patterns borrow ideas from **[gin-vue-admin](https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin)** (the common Go + Gin + Vue admin stack; people sometimes shorthand it as "go-vue-admin"). This repo is a separate implementation: the API is Rust (Axum), not Gin.

## Stack

- Backend: Rust 2024, Axum, SQLx, PostgreSQL, Utoipa Swagger UI
- Frontend: React, Vite, React Router, Zustand, TanStack Query, Axios, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
- Auth: JWT returned by login and sent with the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header



## Workspace layout:

```text
apps/ava           Ava CLI and backend composition root
apps/desktop       React/Vite Admin Console
crates/api         Axum HTTP adapter
crates/audit       structured business and security audit events
crates/auth        password, token, and captcha helpers
crates/db          database connection and migrations
crates/file-storage
crates/iam         users, roles, departments, menus, and access control
crates/metadata    parameters and dictionaries
migrations         SQLx migrations
```



## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` or export the variables in your shell.

Required:

- `HTTP_PORT`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `REDIS_URL` (Redis 8 or newer required)
- `JWT_SECRET`

Optional:

- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`, default `admin`
- `ADMIN_NICKNAME`, default `Administrator`

Required only by `ava init`:

- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`

Example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Default local database URL from `.env.example`:

```text
postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/ava
```

On API startup, the server runs migrations. Default authority, menu, route
registry, and admin user data are initialized by the Ava CLI.

## Run

Start the backend:

```bash
cargo run -p ava serve
```

The API listens on:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Swagger UI:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/swagger-ui/
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The frontend defaults to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

The frontend API base URL defaults to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api
```

Override it with:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000/api pnpm dev
```

Login after running `ava init`:

```text
username: value of ADMIN_USERNAME (default: admin)
password: value of ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

Bootstrap default system data when setting up a database:

```bash
cargo run -p ava init
```

Optionally load the fictional 50-person company data for local development:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f docs/sql/init.sql
```

The optional script adds demo departments, roles, users, role assignments,
parameters, and dictionaries. It does not create login credentials, audit
events, or uploaded-file records.



## Deployment

The backend and Admin Console are deployed as two independent Vercel projects from this monorepo.

### Deploy existing projects

Repository maintainers can deploy the configured backend and frontend projects through the manual
[Deploy to Vercel workflow](https://github.com/nivek-ph/axum-admin/actions/workflows/vercel.yml).

### Create new Vercel projects

Each Vercel Deploy Button creates a new Git repository and one Vercel project. Deploy the backend
and frontend separately, then set the frontend `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the deployed backend URL with
the `/api` suffix.

Backend:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnivek-ph%2Faxum-admin&env=HTTP_PORT%2CDATABASE_URL%2CREDIS_URL%2CJWT_SECRET&envDescription=Configure%20the%20backend%20database%2C%20Redis%2C%20and%20JWT%20secret.&envDefaults=%7B%22HTTP_PORT%22%3A%223000%22%7D&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnivek-ph%2Faxum-admin%23environment&project-name=axum-admin&repository-name=axum-admin)

Frontend:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnivek-ph%2Faxum-admin&root-directory=apps%2Fdesktop&env=VITE_API_BASE_URL&envDescription=Enter%20the%20public%20backend%20API%20base%20URL%2C%20including%20%2Fapi.&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnivek-ph%2Faxum-admin%23deployment&project-name=axum-admin-web&repository-name=axum-admin-web)

The frontend Deploy Button configures Root Directory as `apps/desktop` for Vercel's native Git
deployment. Keep that setting for projects created with the button. Clear it only when reusing this
repository's GitHub Actions workflow, which already runs Vercel CLI from `apps/desktop`.


| Component | Vercel project | Vercel CLI working directory | Project configuration           |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Backend   | `axum-admin`   | Repository root              | `vercel.json` and `api/axum.rs` |
| Frontend  | `axum-admin-web`      | `apps/desktop`               | `apps/desktop/vercel.json`      |


For the existing `axum-admin-web` project deployed through GitHub Actions, leave
**Settings → Build and Deployment → Root Directory** empty. The GitHub Actions job already runs
Vercel CLI from `apps/desktop`; configuring the same directory in Vercel would resolve it twice as
`apps/desktop/apps/desktop`.

Deployments are manual through the **Deploy to Vercel** workflow in
`.github/workflows/vercel.yml`. Running the workflow requires three choices:

1. Select the Git branch to deploy.
2. Select `both`, `backend`, or `frontend` as the deployment target.
3. Select `preview` or `production` as the Vercel environment.

The workflow does not deploy on pushes or pull requests. `preview` creates a non-production
deployment; `production` updates the production deployment and its configured domains.

Configure these GitHub Actions repository secrets before running the workflow:


| Secret                       | Purpose                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID`              | Vercel account or team ID shared by both projects                        |
| `VERCEL_BACKEND_PROJECT_ID`  | Backend Vercel project ID                                                |
| `VERCEL_FRONTEND_PROJECT_ID` | Frontend Vercel project ID                                               |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN`               | Vercel access token used by CI                                           |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL`          | Public backend API base URL used by the frontend build, including `/api` |


Vercel project names and production domains are managed separately. Renaming a project does not
replace an existing production domain; update the project's **Domains** settings when a different
domain is required.

Deployment uploads are isolated with two ignore files:

- `.vercelignore` applies to the backend deployment from the repository root and excludes
`apps/desktop`.
- `apps/desktop/.vercelignore` applies to the frontend deployment and excludes local environment,
dependency, and build-output directories.



## API Contract

Successful responses use a stable envelope:

```json
{
  "code": "OK",
  "message": "ok",
  "data": {}
}
```

Error responses use the same `code` and `message` shape where possible.
Authenticated requests send the JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

## Error Design

- `crates/api` owns the HTTP response envelope and the shared error boundary:
public `AppError` and `AppResult<T>` types. Repeated fixed HTTP contracts use
crate-private `ErrorSpec` constants; callers use ordinary `ok_or` and `?`.
- Stable user-facing error codes and messages live in the owning layer:
domain errors in their owning capability crate and API boundary errors in
`crates/api/src/mappings.rs`, with route-local errors reserved for multi-capability workflows.
- Route and middleware handlers should return `AppResult<T>`.
- Use `impl From<DomainError> for AppError` only when the source error has one
stable HTTP/API meaning everywhere it is used.
- Use explicit `.map_err(...)` at the call site when the same domain error needs
different HTTP semantics in different contexts.
- User-management and authentication errors remain distinct:
  - CRUD/user management returns `UserError` from `crates/iam/src/users`.
  - Login returns `AuthenticateError`; unknown users and incorrect passwords both become
  `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` so the login API does not reveal whether an account exists.
  - Auth middleware loads an Access Snapshot; access evaluation maps missing/deleted
  users to `SESSION_INVALID` and disabled users to `USER_DISABLED`.



## API Overview

Public routes:


| Method | Path                |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/health`       |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`   |
| POST   | `/api/auth/refresh` |
| POST   | `/api/auth/captcha` |


Authenticated route groups:


| Area         | Prefix or route     |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Users        | `/api/users`        |
| Roles        | `/api/roles`        |
| Departments  | `/api/depts`        |

| Params       | `/api/params`       |
| Dictionaries | `/api/dictionaries` |
| Files        | `/api/files`        |
| Audit events | `/api/audit/events` |
| Logout       | `/api/auth/logout`  |


See Swagger UI for the current method-level contract.

## Features

Main Admin Console modules:

- Dashboard
- Users
- Roles
- Menus
- Departments
- Params
- Dictionaries and dictionary details
- Files
- Structured audit events
- Profile

Main workflows:

- Login and current-menu loading
- User list, delete, reset password
- Role CRUD and role-user assignment
- Read-only menu and permission catalog
- Department hierarchy CRUD
- Param CRUD
- Dictionary CRUD
- Dictionary detail CRUD, including child nodes
- File URL import
- File multipart upload with current loading feedback
- File rename and delete
- Audit event filtering and detail inspection
- Profile settings and password change

Percentage upload progress and expanded action-level ACL are future enhancements and do not block
the React parity gate.

## Verification

Backend and workspace tests:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

Frontend tests:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
pnpm test
```

Frontend production build:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
pnpm build
```

Recommended manual integration sweep:

1. Start PostgreSQL for the configured `DATABASE_URL`.
2. Start Redis 8 or newer for the configured `REDIS_URL`.
3. Start the backend with `cargo run -p ava serve`.
4. Start the frontend with `cd apps/desktop && pnpm dev`.
5. Log in with `ADMIN_USERNAME / ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the environment.
6. Complete the fixed parity path: login, a Users workflow, save a non-system
  role's permissions, upload a file, and open an audit-event detail.

React Router uses browser history. Production static hosting must serve `apps/desktop/dist/index.html`
for unknown non-API paths so direct navigation and reloads such as `/roles` continue to work.
